 * WLB scheduler invariant tests.

 * Tests the documented contract of the WLB Datagram scheduler
 * (xqc_scheduler_wlb.c header comment + commit log) under controlled
 * path-state fixtures. The scheduler is exercised through its public
 * callback table; per-path cwnd / SRTT / loss are driven via mocked
 * congestion-control callbacks so each test isolates one invariant.
