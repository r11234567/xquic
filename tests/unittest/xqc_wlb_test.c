 *
 * WLB scheduler invariant tests.
 *
 * These tests exercise the public scheduler callback table
 * (xqc_wlb_scheduler_cb) against a minimal hand-built connection +
 * path-context fixture. The cong-control callback table is mocked so each
 * path's cwnd / inflight can be set independently. SRTT is poked directly
 * into the per-path send_ctl. xqc_monotonic_timestamp is replaced with a
 * fake clock so wlb_flow_expire (gated at 1/sec) can be driven step by
 * step without sleeping.
 *
 * Pin direction is read INDIRECTLY: after invoking the scheduler once to
 * establish a pin for a flow, a second invocation with the same flow hash
 * goes through wlb_flow_lookup and returns the pinned path. We only assert
 * on path_id; we never reach into the scheduler's internal flow table.
