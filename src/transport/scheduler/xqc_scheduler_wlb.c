 *
 * WLB (Weighted Load Balancing) multipath scheduler for QUIC Datagrams.
 *
 * Datagram packets belonging to the same inner flow
 * (identified by po_flow_hash) are pinned to the same QUIC path.  This
 * prevents TCP reordering inside VPN tunnels while still aggregating
 * bandwidth across paths via weighted round-robin of flows.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Learn acknowledged goodput for every eligible path.
 *   2. Normalize goodput with warm-up and exploration floors.
 *   3. Distribute packets with smooth weighted round robin.
 *   4. Pin inner flows to paths via hash table to prevent TCP reordering.
 *   5. If no path can send (all cwnd-blocked), fall back to MinRTT.
 *
 * Soft pinning (cwnd-blocked spillover):
 *   When a flow's pinned path is temporarily cwnd-blocked, the packet is
 *   sent on another path via WRR WITHOUT updating the flow table.  The
 *   flow remains pinned to the original path and returns to it once cwnd
 *   headroom is available.
 *
 *   This "soft pin" trades occasional TCP reordering (caused by RTT
 *   disparity between the pinned path and the spillover path) for two
 *   critical benefits:
 *     - Avoids flow oscillation: strict re-pinning caused flows to get
 *       stuck on a slower path after transient cwnd saturation on the
 *       fast path, degrading throughput by ~20% with few TCP streams.
 *     - Preserves loss resilience: unlike the alternative of blocking
 *       sends until the pinned path's cwnd opens, soft pin keeps packets
 *       flowing during loss events where a path may be blocked for
 *       extended periods.
 *
 *   Measured impact: ~4% throughput overhead with 1 TCP stream over
 *   asymmetric paths (300Mbit/10ms + 80Mbit/30ms) vs single-path.
 *   With 8+ streams the overhead disappears and aggregation gains
 *   dominate (+15-23%).

     * *identical* per-path totals. Weights buy nothing there.

     * there is no deadline layer underneath: a tunnel-side reorder buffer can
     * give up and deliver, QUIC stream reassembly must wait for the
     * retransmission. Its only knob is the buffer bound in xqc_defs.h.
